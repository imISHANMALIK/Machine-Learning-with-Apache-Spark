# Friends By Age Analysis with PySpark 🚀
This PySpark script analyzes friendship data to compute average friends per age group. 🤝📊

## Overview ℹ️
This Python script utilizes PySpark, a powerful analytics engine, to process and analyze data related to friendships. It calculates the average number of friends per age group based on the provided dataset. 📈🔍

## Prerequisites 🛠️
1. Python 3.x 🐍
2. PySpark ⚡

## Installation 📥
To install PySpark, use the following command:
!pip install pyspark

## Usage 🚀
1. Ensure PySpark is installed.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Make sure you have the dataset (fakefriends.csv) or replace the file path in the script with your data source.
4. Run this script using Python:
python
Copy code
from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext

conf = SparkConf().setMaster("local").setAppName("FriendsByAge")
sc = SparkContext(conf=conf)

# ... [Add the rest of the code here]
Code Explanation 💻
The script follows these major steps:

Data Parsing: It reads the data from fakefriends.csv and parses the necessary fields (age and number of friends) using the parseLine() function.
Data Transformation: The script then transforms the data using Spark RDD operations to compute the total number of friends and count for each age group.
Calculating Averages: It computes the average number of friends per age group.
Printing Results: Finally, it collects and prints the results.
Data Format 📄
The script assumes the input data (fakefriends.csv) is in comma-separated values (CSV) format, with columns representing various attributes such as user ID, name, age, and number of friends.

Example Output 📤
The script outputs the computed averages per age group.

Note 📝
This script serves as a basic example. For real-world scenarios, adapt the code as needed for your specific data and analysis requirements.
